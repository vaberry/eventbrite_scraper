Please note that we are a team of two moms + one part time staff person undertaking a major festival at a very new venue that is still evolving. We are also navigating a hostile climate toward LGBTQ+ families and their supporters and are giving as much consideration as within our power to safety.  We ask for your grace, patience and appreciation as we do not have major  funding and full-time staff support and are doing the best we can to make this a fun, safe and supportive event with the capacity and resources we have. Reach out to slomoparty@gmail.com with any additional questions and we will do our best to answer them, but empower you to make the best decisions for you and your families with the information provided.
