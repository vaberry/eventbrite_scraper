Event Description: Orlove by Night Presents:YOI TOKI:A FUTURE FUNK/VAPORWAVE PARTY Future Funk is a Vaporwave subgenre that emerged around 2010 (championed by artists such as Yung Bae, Night Tempo and Macross 82-99) it uses elements of Funk and Disco combined with Japanese City Pop influences, resulting in a sound that is upbeat, insanely danceable and very funky. Future Funk's aesthetic is a mix of nostalgic influences such as 90s anime and '80s consumer culture. The fact that it is derived from Vaporwave goes some way in explaining the familiar and yet strangely unique sound and visualsWith DJs Valentine, Faith in the Glitch, & Ethical DriftSaturday, August 19 2023Subterranean - 2011 W.
